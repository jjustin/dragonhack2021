## Description
We created an intuitive webapp to gather and provide statistical information about side effects of vaccines against covid-19 to better inform the general public and stop the spread of misinformation caused by and causes fear and uncertainty. The app is divided into three different sections. There is the data gathering part, where users submit their personal side effect experience after getting their vaccine shot. Then there is the prediction part, where users can get statistical predictions of their possible side effects. Finally, there is the analysis view, which provides graphical view and numerical knowledge about side effects.
